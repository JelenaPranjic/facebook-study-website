								<h2>The Social One</h2>


								<p>The Social One is often perceived as warm, cheerful and energetic. They prefer to be surrounded by people, as they are very reluctant to be alone. They are very talkative and sociable, which often leads to them making many contacts.
									For those reasons, they are also a pleasure to be around. There is most likely never a dull moment and their warm and joyful demeanor can be very infectious.
									If you are looking for an adventure, an extrovert is the right person to ask. They don’t shy away from risk and adventure.
									But most importantly, you don’t want to have a social gathering without The Social One who is the life of any party and is spreading positive vibes.
								</p>
								<p>On the other hand, <strong> The Social One </strong> can also often have a hectic and dominant effect on his or her fellow human beings.
									They are usually the ones who make decisions without thinking much about them.
									They like to make the decisions, but sometimes lack the calm and rationality to make sure
									they made the right one. It is more learning by doing for The Social One than to think things through
									before approaching them.

								<p>	You were classified as <strong>The Social One</strong> because of your Facebook Likes. This kind of personality assessment is very broad and might not be correct. It is also important to note that each person does not only have one personality trait, but can be described on five traits.

							<h2 style="color: white">The Emotional One</h2>
							<p style="color: white">The Emotional One tends to be rather anxious, impulsive, and emotional. People with this personality trait are prone to empathy and insecurity.
							People who have this factor strongly developed can be more anxious, impulsive and emotional. This personality factor can also be related to characteristics such as insecurity and empathy.
								</p>
								<p style="color: white">
							Neurotic people are usually sensitive, which can make them very good listeners and observers in everyday life.
							Neurotic people can also often seem shy or nervous, because they tend to be socially anxious.
									</p>

									<div class="6u$ 12u$(medium)">
							Overall, high scores in "neuroticism" mean that a person tends to be cautious and therefore often has realistic expectations. Neurotic people also have a strong self-perception, due to their great ability to think reflectively. But this also means that neurotics tend to be particularly self-critical and are more prone to stress. The high sensitivity of neurotic people can also mean that they are often melancholic, depressed, irritable and moody.
							But most importantly, because of their depth, neurotic people are ideal listeners to ask for advice.
