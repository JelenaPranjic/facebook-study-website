								<h2>The Thoughtful One</h2>


								<p>The Thoughtful One tends to be considered cautious, reserved and serious. They can seem distant and withdrawn. Especially in new situations, surrounded by new people, they observe the situation first before revealing too much of themselves.
										They simply prefer doing things by themselves but not because they lack social competence, they rather enjoy their independence and spending their time by themselves.
										On top of that, The Thoughtful One is a great observer, they absorb situations carefully before actively participating.
										They avoid saying too much unnecessarily and only express themselves when they think it is important.
								</p>
								<p>All this can make them seem very wise and you will most likely hear great advice from them.
										On the other hand, because of their preference for being alone, they can be misjudged as unhappy,
										although they just often don’t feel the need for company.
										<strong>The Thoughtful One </strong>avoids expressing their emotions openly, they rather keep a lot of things to themselves, which can make them appear unapproachable and distant. You’ll probably also find yourself struggling to keep
										up small talk with <strong>The Thoughtful One </strong>.

								<p>	You were classified as <strong>The Thoughtful One</strong> because of your Facebook Likes. This kind of personality assessment is very broad and might not be correct. It is also important to note that each person does not only have one personality trait, but can be described on five traits.

							<h2 style="color: white">The Emotional One</h2>
							<p style="color: white">The Emotional One tends to be rather anxious, impulsive, and emotional. People with this personality trait are prone to empathy and insecurity.
							People who have this factor strongly developed can be more anxious, impulsive and emotional. This personality factor can also be related to characteristics such as insecurity and empathy.
								</p>
								<p style="color: white">
							Neurotic people are usually sensitive, which can make them very good listeners and observers in everyday life.
							Neurotic people can also often seem shy or nervous, because they tend to be socially anxious.
									</p>

									<div class="6u$ 12u$(medium)">
							Overall, high scores in "neuroticism" mean that a person tends to be cautious and therefore often has realistic expectations. Neurotic people also have a strong self-perception, due to their great ability to think reflectively. But this also means that neurotics tend to be particularly self-critical and are more prone to stress. The high sensitivity of neurotic people can also mean that they are often melancholic, depressed, irritable and moody.
							But most importantly, because of their depth, neurotic people are ideal listeners to ask for advice.

In this study, we are investigating how people react to personalisation and explanations about this personalisation. E.g. people with different personality types see different ads. As this is a very effective marketing strategy, it is important to raise more transperancy about personality-tailored ads.
