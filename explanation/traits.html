									</div>

									<div class="6u$ 12u$(medium)">
										<p>
											The Artsy One has a very creative mind and is oftentimes considered to be intelligent. They are very open towards new experiences and new ideas. They are full of curiosity, they love art and creativity in general.
											They also tend to have good sense for aesthetics which is probably a consequence of their great creativity.

										</p>
										<p>
											In addition, they tend to be very open about different cultures, norms and opinions.
											They meet everyone and everything with an open mind and really take their time to appreciate
											and think about different views. They are the perfect conversation partner for philosophical views and ideas.
											That is why The Artsy One tends to have liberal views and avoids blindly following traditions.
											They also avoid routines and strive for constant change and new experiences.
										</p>
									<p>
										On the other hand, The Artsy One could struggle with committing themselves to something and
										settling down as they tend to get bored easily.
										Their need for new experiences can make them restless and their open and creative minds can cause them to lose their connection to reality.
										They could also be called “The Day Dreamer”.

											<div class="6u$ 12u$(medium)">

												<p>
													The Traditional One tends to have a conventional and traditional outlook on life. They are okay with living slow and comfortable lives, they don’t seek to experience new things. Their motto in life is probably something like “Never change a running system”.
													The Traditional One will most likely choose a relaxed holiday somewhere familiar rather than going on crazy adventures.
												</p>
												<p>
													They don’t seek out the thrill in life and are very content with what they have and what is familiar.
													The Traditional One prefers familiar routines and tends not to have many different interests but rather focuses on certain things and interests.
													They are considered more conservative than liberal, they appreciate family, traditions and religion.
												</p>
												<p>
													Through their avoidance of new experiences, they can appear more narrow-minded and less open to new ideas.
													Consequently, The Traditional One can be less accepting or tolerant for different lifestyles and cultures.

															<img alt="icon for trait" class="icon" src="images/hc.png">


													</div>

													<div class="6u$ 12u$(medium)">

														<p>
															The Organized One is considered to be an excellent planner. They seem very put together and organized.
															They will finish any task they receive very thoroughly and efficiently which makes them very competent employees.
														</p>
														<p>
															On top of that, conscientious individuals are very ambitious and don’t shy away from putting in the extra work to achieve their goal. They are hard workers and very persistent.
															Other than that, humans with that trait have a reflective and considerate demeanor. They will take any obligation towards someone very seriously and you can always rely on them.
														</p>
														<p>
															On the other hand, they will probably avoid joining spontaneous activities as they like to have everything perfectly planned out and avoid chaos as much as possible.
															The Organized One tends to be a perfectionist and oftentimes tends to be a workaholic as well as showing some compulsive behavior.
															They also make sure that everything around them is neat and in its place which can make them seem pedantic.

																<h2>The Spontaneous One</h2>
																	<img alt="icon for trait" class="icon" src="images/lc.png">


															</div>

															<div class="6u$ 12u$(medium)">
																<p>
																	The Spontaneous One loves chaos and spontaneity, they don’t bother making plans in advance but rather just enjoy living in the moment.
																	They tend not to be organized and come across very relaxed.
																</p>
																<p>
																	They are easy-going people who don’t occupy themselves much with time-keeping or stress. They simply tend to enjoy the beauty of life.
																	Other than that, you can expect The Spontaneous One to be very straightforward as they say whatever comes to their mind.
																</p>
																<p>
																	But they also tend to show impulsive behavior.
																	The Spontaneous One doesn’t think much about something in advance and is oftentimes not aware of the consequences of their behavior.
																	This may also lead to putting off tasks or not doing them at all, especially if they are bored or not interested in the work,
																	they won’t probably complete it or do it heartlessly.

												<h2>The Social One</h2>
														<img alt="icon for trait" class="icon" src="images/he.png">


											</div>

											<div class="6u$ 12u$(medium)">

												<p>
												The Social One is often perceived as warm, cheerful and energetic. They prefer to be surrounded by people, as they are very reluctant to be alone. They are very talkative and sociable, which often leads to them making many contacts.
												For those reasons, they are a pleasure to be around.
												</p>
												<p>
													There is most likely never a dull moment and their warm and joyful demeanor can be very infectious.
												If you are looking for an adventure, an extrovert is the right person to ask. They don’t shy away from risk and adventure.
												But most importantly, you don’t want to have a social gathering without The Social One who is the life of any party and is spreading positive vibes.
												</p>
											<p>
												On the other hand, The Social One can also often have a hectic and dominant effect on his or her fellow human beings.
												They are usually the ones who make decisions without thinking much about them.
												They like to make the decisions but sometimes lack the calm and rationality to make sure they made the right one.
												It is more learning by doing for The Social One than to think things through before approaching them.

														<h2>The Thoughtful One</h2>
															<img alt="icon for trait" class="icon" src="images/le-3.png">


													</div>

													<div class="6u$ 12u$(medium)">
														<p>
														The Thoughtful One tends to be considered cautious, reserved and serious.
														They can seem distant and withdrawn. Especially in new situations, surrounded by new people, they observe the situation first before revealing too much about themselves.
														</p>
														<p>
															They prefer doing things by themselves but not because they lack social competence, they rather enjoy their independence and spending their time by themselves.
															On top of that, The Thoughtful One is a great observer, they absorb situations carefully before actively participating.
															They avoid saying too much unnecessarily and only express themselves when they think it is important.
															All this can make them seem very wise and you will most likely hear great advice from them.
														</p>
													<p>

															On the other hand, because of their preference for being alone, they can be misjudged as unhappy,
															although they just often don’t feel the need for company.
															The Thoughtful One avoids expressing their
															emotions openly, they rather keep a lot of things to themselves, which can make them appear unapproachable and distant.
															You’ll probably also find yourself struggling to keep up small talk with The Thoughtful One.

																			<div class="6u$ 12u$(medium)">

																				<p>
																					The Kind One has a very strong inclination to harmony and is often considered good-natured, understanding and compassionate. If someone needs help, they are immediately on hand. They love helping others, which is why The Kind One oftentimes tends to do voluntary work.
																					As a friend they will probably never let you down and will always have an open ear for you.
																					They usually appear modest and generous. They have a very considerate and honest manner,
																					they are the friend you can blindly trust.
																				</p>
																				<p>
																					All in all, The Kind One is a team player, who will always put the success and needs of the entire group before their own.
																					This makes them very desirable in a working environment as well as in friendship groups.
																				</p>
																				<p>
																					On the other hand, The Kind One runs the risk to not pay enough attention to what they need and concentrate
																					too much on pleasing others.
																					They are also usually a bit gullible and trusting towards other people,
																					which is why they tend to get ripped over or used by others.

																							The Ambitious One tends to be very (as the name suggests) ambitious. They have a strong goal in mind and do everything to achieve that. They also tend to win any discussion as they don’t like being in the wrong and will always
																							find arguments which support their view, even if they are not necessarily based on truth or facts.
																						</p>
																						<p>
																							The Ambitious One tends to have great success in their career and you will most likely find them in high positions. They are also usually the ones who don’t just blindly follow
																							rules and do challenge authority, which can make them great visionaries who think out of the box.
																						</p>
																						<p>
																							But The Ambitious One can also come across as arrogant or full of themselves and sometimes even a bit heartless. This is not necessarily true since
																							non-agreeable people just tend to focus on themselves and 	their goals instead of occupying themselves with other people’s opinions or emotions.

																								<h2>The Emotional One</h2>
																									<img alt="icon for trait" class="icon" src="images/hn.png">

																							</div>

																							<div class="6u$ 12u$(medium)">
																								<p>
																								The Emotional One tends to be rather anxious, impulsive and emotional. They experience emotions quite intensively, which leads to them being sensitive.
																								Perhaps their sensitivity drives their strong need to provide for others. Someone you can rely on to help you out.
																								</p>
																								<p>
																								On top of that, they tend to be cautious which leads them to having realistic expectations, most of the time. Generally, the emotional one avoids taking risks which can protect them from making big mistakes.
																								One of the greatest qualities in people with this personality trait is their strong self-perception, due to their ability to think reflectively.
																								</p>
																								<p>
																									On the other hand, this also means that they can be particularly self-critical and more prone to stress than the average person.
																								This also leads to more insecurity, they’re often nervous and might seem shy, as they tend to be socially anxious.
																									The high sensitivity of The Emotional One might also make them melancholic, depressed, irritable and moody at times.

																									<div class="6u$ 12u$(medium)">

																										<p>
																											The Calm & Confident One tends to be rather confident, unafraid, easy-going and carefree.
																											They are usually perceived as content and very pleasant to be around. They’re very much appreciated in a work environment, as they know how to deal with stressful situations and are the ones to always keep a cool head in demanding situations.
																										</p>
																										<p>
																											On top of that, they’re considered to have a high frustration threshold, which can be very helpful when things don’t go as planned.
																											Their great ability to keep calm most of the time is due to them not experiencing emotions as intensely as sensitive people.
																										</p>
																										<p>
																										But this also causes The Calm & Confident One to maybe not understand feelings of anxiety or worrying.
																											Their even-temperedness, patience and objectiveness can lead to them  not being as relatable as someone who shows emotions, vulnerability and some insecurity.

							<h2 style="color: white">The Emotional One</h2>
							<p style="color: white">The Emotional One tends to be rather anxious, impulsive, and emotional. People with this personality trait are prone to empathy and insecurity.
							People who have this factor strongly developed can be more anxious, impulsive and emotional. This personality factor can also be related to characteristics such as insecurity and empathy.
								</p>
								<p style="color: white">
							Neurotic people are usually sensitive, which can make them very good listeners and observers in everyday life.
							Neurotic people can also often seem shy or nervous, because they tend to be socially anxious.
									</p>

									<div class="6u$ 12u$(medium)">
							Overall, high scores in "neuroticism" mean that a person tends to be cautious and therefore often has realistic expectations. Neurotic people also have a strong self-perception, due to their great ability to think reflectively. But this also means that neurotics tend to be particularly self-critical and are more prone to stress. The high sensitivity of neurotic people can also mean that they are often melancholic, depressed, irritable and moody.
							But most importantly, because of their depth, neurotic people are ideal listeners to ask for advice.
