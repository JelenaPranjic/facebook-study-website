				And also this data is completely anonymous!
				All we want is to raise awareness to your digital footprint and how it could be used.
				We don’t know what your Facebook interests and likes are, only Facebook has this information.
				And with this information Facebook can show ads to specific target groups with similar interests.</blockquote>

				  <p>We can make assumptions about your personality solely based on your Facebook page likes.
						Your personality profile is solely based on the pages you have liked on Facebook. Scientific research suggests that
						liking specific Facebook pages is associated with personality traits, for example,
						people who are rather extroverted tend be interested in <strong>Parties, Dancing </strong>or <strong>"Slightly Stoopid"</strong>. Apart from the pages you liked, you were also shown these ads because you live in the US, you are female,
						and between 18 and 35 years old. No other data was used.
						If you want to know how this works in more detail, <a href="study.html#learn">learn more about it here.</a>
					We do not sell any actual products and have not collected any data about you.
					Our goal is to inform people about how their data is used online and therefore raise transparency
					for advertising tailored to individual personality.
					In the future, it is likely that a lot of your personal information, e.g.
						demographics, how much you are posting, chatting, etc. will be used to compute even
						 more detailed personality profiles. Advertisers can then use this information to show you
						 only ads that probably appeal more to you due to your personality. There are a lot of different
						 approaches to analysing people’s personality based on their online behavior.

											<h2>The Social One</h2>


											<p>The Social One is often perceived as warm, cheerful and energetic. They prefer to be surrounded by people, as they are very reluctant to be alone. They are very talkative and sociable, which often leads to them making many contacts.
												For those reasons, they are also a pleasure to be around. There is most likely never a dull moment and their warm and joyful demeanor can be very infectious.
												If you are looking for an adventure, an extrovert is the right person to ask. They don’t shy away from risk and adventure.
												But most importantly, you don’t want to have a social gathering without The Social One who is the life of any party and is spreading positive vibes.
										  </p>
											<p>On the other hand, <strong> The Social One </strong> can also often have a hectic and dominant effect on his or her fellow human beings.
												They are usually the ones who make decisions without thinking much about them.
												They like to make the decisions, but sometimes lack the calm and rationality to make sure
												they made the right one. It is more learning by doing for The Social One than to think things through
												before approaching them.

It is also important to note that each person does not only have one personality trait, but can be described on five traits.

In this study, we are investigating how people react to personalisation and explanations about this personalisation. E.g. people with different personality types see different ads.
