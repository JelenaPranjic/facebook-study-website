			<blockquote> This is part of a research project. We don’t collect any data from you. We don’t have any data about your personality traits.
				The only data we collect is, how many people clicked on our facebook ad.
				And also this data is completely anonymous!
				All we want is to raise awareness to your digital footprint and how it could be used.
				We don’t know what your Facebook interests and likes are, only Facebook has this information.
				And with this information Facebook can show ads to specific target groups with similar interests.</blockquote>

				  <p>We can make assumptions about your personality solely based on your Facebook page likes.
						Your personality profile is solely based on the pages you have liked on Facebook. Scientific research suggests that
						liking specific Facebook pages is associated with personality traits, for example,
						people who are rather extroverted tend be interested in <strong>"Stargate", Computers </strong>or <strong>"Serenity"</strong>. Apart from the pages you liked, you were also shown these ads because you live in the US, you are female,
						and between 18 and 35 years old. No other data was used.
						If you want to know how this works in more detail, <a href="study.html#learn">learn more about it here.</a>
					We do not sell any actual products and have not collected any data about you.
					Our goal is to inform people about how their data is used online and therefore raise transparency
					for advertising tailored to individual personality.
					In the future, it is likely that a lot of your personal information, e.g.
						demographics, how much you are posting, chatting, etc. will be used to compute even
						 more detailed personality profiles. Advertisers can then use this information to show you
						 only ads that probably appeal more to you due to your personality. There are a lot of different
						 approaches to analysing people’s personality based on their online behavior.

									<h2>The Observant One</h2>


									<p>The Observant One tends to be considered cautious, reserved and serious. They can seem distant and withdrawn. Especially in new situations, surrounded by new people, they observe the situation first before revealing too much of themselves.
											They simply prefer doing things by themselves but not because they lack social competence, they rather enjoy their independence and spending their time by themselves.
											On top of that, The Observant One is a great observer, they absorb situations carefully before actively participating.
											They avoid saying too much unnecessarily and only express themselves when they think it is important.
									</p>
									<p>All this can make them seem very wise and you will most likely hear great advice from them.
											On the other hand, because of their preference for being alone, they can be misjudged as unhappy,
											although they just often don’t feel the need for company.
											<strong>The Observant One </strong>avoids expressing their emotions openly, they rather keep a lot of things to themselves, which can make them appear unapproachable and distant. You’ll probably also find yourself struggling to keep
											up small talk with <strong>The Observant One </strong>.

It is also important to note that each person does not only have one personality trait, but can be described on five traits.

										<p>	You have seen this ad on Facebook as part of a scientific research study conducted at LMU Munich, Germany. In this study, we are investigating how people react to personalisation and explanations about this personalisation. E.g. people with different personality types see different ads. As this is a very effective marketing strategy, it is important to raise more transperancy about personality-tailored ads.
