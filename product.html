				  <p>We can make assumptions about your personality solely based on your Facebook page likes.
						Your personality profile is solely based on the pages you have liked on Facebook. Scientific research suggests that liking specific Facebook pages is associated with personality traits, for example, people who are rather extroverted tend to like <strong>Beerpong, Socializing, Dancing</strong>. Apart from the pages you liked, you were also shown these ads because you live in the US, you are female, and between 18 and 35 years old. No other data was used. If you want to know how this works in more detail, <a href="#learn">learn more about it here.</a>
					We do not sell any actual products and have not collected any data about you.
					Our goal is to inform people about how their data is used online and therefore raise transparency
					for advertising tailored to individual personality.
					In the future, it is likely that a lot of your personal information, e.g.
						demographics, how much you are posting, chatting, etc. will be used to compute even
						 more detailed personality profiles. Advertisers can then use this information to show you
						 only ads that probably appeal more to you due to your personality. There are a lot of different
						 approaches to analysing people’s personality based on their online behavior.

											<h2>The Emotional One</h2>

											<img alt="icon for trait" class="icon" src="images/emtional.png">

											<p>The Emotional One tends to be rather anxious, impulsive and emotional. They experience emotions quite intensively, which leads to them being sensitive.
Perhaps their sensitivity drives their strong need to provide for others. Someone you can rely on to help you out.
On top of that, they tend to be cautious which leads them to having realistic expectations, most of the time. Generally, the emotional one avoids taking risks which can protect them from making big mistakes.
One of the greatest qualities in people with this personality trait is their strong self-perception, due to their ability to think reflectively.

											<p>On the other hand, this also means that they can be particularly self-critical and more prone to stress than the average person. This also leads to more insecurity, they’re often nervous and might seem shy, as they tend to be socially anxious.
											The high sensitivity of <strong>The Emotional One might make them melancholic, depressed, irritable and moody at times.

											<p>	You were classified as <strong>The Emotional One</strong> because of your Facebook Likes. This kind of personality assessment is very broad and might not be correct. It is also important to note that each person does not only have one personality trait, but can be described on five traits. Learn more about this HERE. </p>
